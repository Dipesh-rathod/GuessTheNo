# GuessTheNo
This is basically java and xml based Android Application in which a user can guess a number.
The number should be in range based on the level of a game.
There are mainly 3 level available in the game such that easy, normal and hard.
These application is developed by me using android studio.
As, I told you the project(game) contains 3 level easy, normal and hard.
    A) Easy : Here the number lies between range of 0 to 9.
    B) Normal : Here the number lies between range of 10 to 99.
    C) Hard : Here the number lies between range of 100 to 999.

If it does not show safe while installing the app, do not worry as this app has not yet been uploaded to the Play Store.
