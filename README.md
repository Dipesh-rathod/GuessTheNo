# GuessTheNo
This is basically java and xml based Android Application in which a user can guess a number. 
The number should be in range based on the level of a game. 
There are mainly 3 level available in the game such that easy, normal and hard.
These application is done by me using android studio.
As, I told you the project(game) contains 3 level easy, normal and hard.
  A) Easy : Here the no lies between range of 0 to 9.
  B) Normal : Here the no lies between range of 10 to 99.
  C) Hard : Here the no lies between range of 100 to 999.
